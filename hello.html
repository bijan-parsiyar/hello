    <!-- git clone <filename> - was used to clone a respository, take a repository and download it 
        onto our own computer
    -->
    <!-- git add <filename> -  let us tell git I would like to add a file take a save, commit, or a snapshot of all these files so I can
        refer back to them later. git add <filename> it will be saved the next time
     I  make a commit, only when you have a select few you want to save that's 
     why, that's why we have git add
        git commit <filename> - git commit -m "message" - a snapshot of a version of a code keeping
            track of the old versions that use to live there inside of the repository
